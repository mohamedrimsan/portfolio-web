    <h1>👨‍💻 Cybersecurity Projects</h1>
    <div class="text-always-black">
      <h2>Project 1: Home Lab for Defensive Cybersecurity 🏠 💻 🧪 🔧</h2>
      <p id="justify">To gain hands-on experience in defensive cybersecurity, I built a custom home lab designed to simulate real-world enterprise environments. The setup includes virtualized endpoints and servers segmented across networks, protected by firewalls and monitored using advanced detection tools. This lab enables me to practice critical blue team skills such as log analysis, threat detection, alert tuning, and incident response. By working with real traffic and simulated attacks, I’ve developed a strong foundation in monitoring, identifying, and mitigating cybersecurity threats in a controlled and practical setting.</p>
